# Mapping_Earthquakes

The exercise's objective was to learn how to create maps and show different information by adding points, polygons, and GeoJSON data, along with becoming familiar with how to stylize the map. The challenge was to develop a map with three base maps with an earthquake and tectonic plates overlay. The circles represent earthquakes in the last week of 29/6/2020, and the radius is proportionate to the magnitude. A legend in the bottom right corner shows the magnitude of the earthquake with a color code.

## Source

The tectonic plates overlay was taken from <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json>. Peter Bird created the tectonic plate model, Hugo Ahlenius provided the dataset on Github, and Corey Sterling formatted the GeoJSON data.

### Technologies

The exercise employs JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Leaflet, and Mapbox.
